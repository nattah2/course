* COSC 3360 Project 3
This project implement's Professor Rincon's entropy scheduling algorithm over a server.

To use, compile the client and server with ~make~ and run as follows:

#+begin_src bash
./client hostname port
#+end_src

Once a connection is opened, the client expects input in the same format given by the prompt, e.g.

#+begin_quote
A 2 B 4 C 3 A 7
#+end_quote

where the letters represent a task and the numbers represent the length of time that the task takes.
