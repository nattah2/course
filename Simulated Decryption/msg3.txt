Mr. Moran,

My agent will meet you in person for the exchange. Hand him the diamond, and he will hand you the money. When you approach him, say the secret phrase that I attached to confirm your identity. 

To protect my agent's identity from those nosy detectives, I have encrypted the description of his physical appearance. For the encryption, I used a cipher in ECB mode with a very secret key that we exchanged a long time ago. The plaintext is a BMP file.

Sincerely,
Prof. Moriarty
