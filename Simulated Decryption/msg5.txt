Mr. Moran,

I have encrypted the exact location of the meeting. You may decrypt the ciphertext using the following information:
- plaintext is a BMP file;
- encryption is AES in CBC mode with ISO10126Padding padding;
- IV is 16 zero bytes;
- key is my birthdate: first byte is the year (just two digits, i.e., number between 0 and 99), second byte is the month, third byte is the day, and the remaining bytes are all zero.

Sincerely,
Professor Moriarty
